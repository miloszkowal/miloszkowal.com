# Introduction

I want to start tracking my expenditures on a more consistent basis, as knowing when money goes is a key component of a sound financial mind.

# Method

I use a simple Google Sheets template where I write down each expenditure. It also tracks my cashback based on which card I use, since different cards offer different cashback rewards.

# February 2020

The biggest expenditure this month was buying records. I like records, even though I don't have a record player yet. This is a bigger purchase that I'm saving up for now.
