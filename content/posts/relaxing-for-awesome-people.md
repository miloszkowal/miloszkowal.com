## Introduction, or Why Even Relax?

In the book *Your Money or Your Life*, Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin describe that in a time before electricity, people only worked for three hours a day. This means that they spent the rest of the time working on their own personal pursuits, which were mostly family oriented. Those in positions of what we now consider "white collar work," might take on other activities, such as hunting, reading, etc. (assuming literacy, of course). However, no matter your position on the social totem pole, you took the initiative to relax, in whatever way suited you. This served as a way to recharge your mind and your body (mostly the latter, as a lot of work back in those days was manual labor), and also take the time to work on your community affairs, especially religious life and family bonding. Studies time and time again showed that meaningful connection is the key to long-lasting happiness and life satisfaction, and our serf ancestors seem to have understood that implicitly. So what's changed?

## The Modern, Wasteful View of Relaxation

Part of the change can be attributed to the rise of the "information economy." As more and more people migrate from the rural areas to urban cities, their likelihood to engage in manual labor decreases. Case in point, myself. The most manual labor that I do is replanting my plants when it's time to move them into a new pot. And yet my body and mind long for a return to hard work on a farm, mostly expressed by blasting John Denver. I believe that most folks, especially folks in their early 20s and 30s, are held hostage by the information around them, in the form of their phones (yes, I know, "phones bad" isn't a valid argument), advertising, cable TV, etc. And this need for constant information input has bled into the sphere of relaxation.

You see it everywhere - going out virtually every night, especially on Friday nights, maxing out their credit cards drinking very expensive martinis. Then they take a look at their bank account and “Holy crap, how do I have negative eight dollars here?" These kinds of people usually use much more colorful language. Of course, this is slightly exaggerating, but the general gist is the same - a lack of mindfulness about where their money is going.

This is the modern view of relaxation - spending lots of money, leaving the house (or sometimes never leaving the house), and in general just wasting your life away on pursuits that if we really ask ourselves, don't give us much life satisfaction, but in fact leave us craving more.[^1] If you ask people how many hours a day or a week they waste, it usually comes out to about 4 hours a day[^2] - things like watching YouTube videos that you don’t really care about, general procrastination, and anything else that takes us away from the task we should actually be doing, whether it is work, school, or our familial obligations. Those that tell you they waste no time are either Elon Musk or they're lying.

What if I told you there’s a different way to handle this? A different way to be leisurely, and in turn, a more awesome way to refresh your mind and body to do the things that you’re really born to do. Introducing the concept of Intentional Relaxation (IR), which will be the way you relax from now on.

## The Anatomy of Intentional Relaxation

But what is IR? First of all, it’s a system of looking at the world with pure intentionality. In my codex vitae[^3], one of my core tenets is that I do everything with a sense of purpose. I’m not perfect about it, but I do a damn good job being mindful of the time I spend and what I spend it on. Applying the mode of mindfulness or intentionality to your relaxation is the next natural step. This means taking the time to be mindful of your relaxation, and maybe even organize and schedule it.

Of course, I can already hear the protesters coming out of the woodwork holding their pitchforks screaming “he wants to organize our relaxation! Is nothing sacred anymore?” Some believe that in order to be truly relaxed, it must happen organically. But if we do our best work by putting it in writing in a calendar and then setting these appointments with ourselves, why can’t we do the same things with our leisure time? Of course we can. Much like everything else, it is only a matter of actually sitting down and committing to do something and make the change.

### Physical Exercise as a Form of Leisure

What we do during those leisure times is just as important as the leisure times themselves. I’ll be the first to admit that I enjoy eating ice cream and binging YouTube videos, but I also realize that such a method of relaxation is only destined to destroy me. Sitting on my chair with my feet on my desk and eating ice cream is a recipe for a shorter lifespan and a larger waistline. Even just sitting is a recipe for a bad back and health problems down the line. Therefore, it is imperative that we find leisure time that not only relaxes us, but also provides some sort of benefits.

The first obvious one is exercise. Many people dread exercise, as it is a laborious task: you have to get yourself to the gym, you have to find the clothing you’re going to wear, you have to go and do the exercises (and God forbid there’s someone on the machine when you want to use it - I know I’m guilty of that when I had a gym membership), and then you have to shower and get yourself back before it’s too dark, because you want to eat dinner. But that's how victims think. They go to the gym because they know it’s good for you, just like they eat kale salad while hating it. There’s a better way to exercise, in your home, using only your body. Body weight fitness is quickly becoming a large phenomenon in the fitness zeitgeist, and for good reason: it removes all the above excuses - you can work out naked if you really wanted to. Personally, I make it a point to do at least a core workout every single day. I also go outside (walking or biking) for at least an hour a day. This convinces my body and myself that I'm still a member of this world after I've been inside sitting in front of a computer for several hours a day.

Exercise, of course, has the great benefits of providing the endorphins you need to function happily and an exercise session in the middle of your work shift has shown to dramatically improve focus after the “lunch slump.” This is doubly true if you have a mentally-taxing job, such as an accountant or a programmer. After several hours of hard mental work, your brain is screaming for some physical labor, so why not indulge it?

### Mental Exercise as a Form of Leisure

My roommate works in construction, so it’s not really in his best interest to bust out a quick run during his lunch break, as he is already getting plenty of physical exercise during the main hours of his workday. So instead, I recommend a “mental workout” as leisure time. Reading, writing, or learning a language are great options for that. According to Duolingo’s loading screens, learning a language improves memory and concentration skills, something that we desperately need in this day and age.

Overall, leisure time should take the form of the opposite of what your main job is. I’m privileged enough to have a problem solving job in which I stand in front of a desk, so my recreation time is focused on building my body and pushing my limits in that way. To those more inclined to the physical work, mental leisure tasks will provide the greatest
benefit. My dad works in a print shop, and he almost always has a book with him so that he can read during his breaks or when the machine is running and he just has to supervise.

The core of relaxation should be yourself and bringing yourself back into the work that you were destined to do. There is no use lounging around if there are problems to be solved. You are a very important member of our society, so it’s your responsibility to contribute to it in a meaningful way so that you can reap the benefits now and later as well.
Leisure and relaxation need to be what happens during your breaks, instead of your work happening during those breaks and you surfing Reddit during the times when you should be working (I was guilty of that myself).

So go out there and relax.

[^1]: This is not to imply that these pursuits are wasteful. I'm saying that an overabundance of these kinds of pursuits is wasteful. Most of modern life is, in the words of Mr. Money Mustache, "an exploding volcano of wastefulness," and it's our responsibility (I would argue duty) to reduce this waste, as a benefit to ourselves, our society, and our planet.
