In my ongoing effort to DeGoogle, I have decided to remove Google Analytics from the website. I would love to get some other analytics system onto the page, since seeing the demographcis and the general makeup of the page might be helpful. But also, I might not care, since I generally write what I want - maybe the analytics serve more as a personal validation tool than anything else. Who knows? Either way, Google Analytics is gone.

I did add YouTube to my front page, though, for when I eventually revive the channel. Maybe I should go to BitChute instead.
