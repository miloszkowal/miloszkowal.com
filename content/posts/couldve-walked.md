I recently stumbled across this post by an executive at a Silicon Valley company:

What struck me about was that it seemed almost like a shill for Uber, in the sense that this person is trying to leave their current company to join Uber. Yes, Uber's "you can pay later" feature is nice, but is it really worth the environmental impact of driving across a walkable bridge? Personally, I don't think so, and neither should any of the people who work in Silicon Valley and constantly espouse environmental doctrine. I want to take this blog post as a quick tear-apart of this post, and how an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

First of all, why is your card declined? The most common reason I know of for a card decline in an app or a service is that the limit was reached. Since this is a (presumably) high-paid executive, he must have a high credit limit to match. So what can he possibly be spending on such that the card has been declined? Of course, this is me assuming that the reason for the decline is indeed maxing out the limit. Giving this man the benefit of the doubt, let's say that it was an internal error on Uber's part in the card processing. This happens often, as it the case with the doubling order case that Postmates suffered some time ago[^1]. His second line of the post would not have worked either if the issue was indeed a server error. No matter what card you put in, it should throw the same error.

The "I have no idea where I am" line really floored me. Just from the image, I was able to gleam that this man is on Treasure Island off of mainland San Francisco. I was also able to gleam that there is a bus route that serves treasure island and would drop him off directly in downtown SF, where he would be treated to a myriad of other public transportation solutions to reach his destination (presumably wanting to get back to the office)[^2]. A feigning of weakness (ignorance) where it's blatantly false (if I, on the other side of the country know where he is, there is no excuse for him not to know) for the sake of a joke and a shill for Uber is pathetic and on par with what I expect from the rest of the LinkedIn technocratic crowd. You always know where you are if you have a phone. Bonus points if you know where you are if you don't have a phone. There's a lot to be said for tech-free skills.

The ending of this short post is great, and such a ham-handed way to praise Uber, and is another sign of weakness. This person makes it seem like he was on some kind of deserted island and only Uber could have saved him from a lifetime of eating coconuts and drawing "SOS" in the sand. Give me a break, man. You're a grown man and you couldn't walk across the bridge or take the bus? You couldn't call a friend to pick you up? You had to rely on someone else who's making pennies on the dollar (recent CA legislation notwithstanding)[^3] just so that you can take your pompous ass across a potentially _swimmable_ water channel?

But this speaks to a much greater problem that plagues Silicon Valley and all of California. The people in the extremely high positions of status (celebrities, technocrats, etc.) believe in the "one rule for me, one for thee" paradigm. They will be the first to espouse moral talking points, but quietly sweep all of their problems under the rug (looking at you, Tim Cook - I'm writing this on a Mac by the way). This particular company doesn't actually have any environmental policy that I can find, which more or less lets them off the hook for their executive's weakness. But many companies do, and yet they use extremely inefficient server farms, they ship products from across the Pacific, and take Ubers around a city with a burgeoning cyclist population[^4]. And yet they will be the first to scream that climate change is causing the problems of the modern world. I personally believe that everyone should live what they preach, especially in issues of great importance, such as climate change.

This problem of Silicon Valley pontification is only going to get worse as these services gain in popularity and their user base grows. And while these services are free to do what they wish in terms of their product, they are starting to become editorial in their policies, removing things that most people would not find objectionable on their own moral grounds. One of the best courses of action that I can see to combat this menace is to stop using the services altogether and embrace a lifestyle that dominated before Facebook and Twitter were seen as the primary means of communication.
