# Introduction

The recent and not-so-recent data breaches from the world’s top tech companies (Facebook, Google, Equifax, NordVPN, etc.) brings to light a very interesting question whether or not the government should step and legislate these companies. The idea is that the government would be able to dictate the terms on which companies can use our data, and provide security for the consumer of these big services. The European Union started a prototype of this “Internet Bill of Rights” with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and California in the United States is soon to follow with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2020. However, there is an obvious, and better way to handle and check the growing stranglehold of the tech giants over the consumers: decentralization and education.

The two really go hand-in-hand. In the “old days” of the internet, everyone had their own MySpace page or BoingBoing blog. These were simply precursors to the current problem, but they also planted the seed of personalized and decentralized websites. With MySpace, you can customize your own page with whatever you want (including custom scripts, which proved a security disaster), and songs. While I personally never a user of BoingBoing, I’m sure similar personalization options were permissible. Today, your social media networks all look the same (Facebook pages all look the same, YouTube channels all look the same, etc.). We, as consumers of these services, are at the mercy of the systems we use, instead of being the ones in control.

# Decentralization

We are also at the mercy of governments, and the court of public opinion. Tumblr’s controversial opinion to ban pornographic content on their platform results in some backlash, which can potentially sink the service. Of course, porn will never go away on the internet, but certain governments would certainly like to believe that (England footnote here). In fact, banning things has repeatedly been shown to increase demand for the product.

I’m the first to tell you that we should have the internet be less controlled by the government not more. (There needs to be a bit about net neutrality here). And the solution to that isn’t to put our trust in big corporations who exist only to serve you ads. The answer is a little bit of education about computer technology, and having your own little piece of the internet.

The thing about the terms of service is that they don’t exist to protect you as the user. They exist to protect the company from litigation. That’s why individuals from Patreon have been dropped for seemingly no reason and had to turn to a platform like SubscribeStar, who doesn’t judge based on political belief. The same holds true for Twitter and the like, who have a track record of just banning people for no reason. Even Google seems to be in on this, with blocking advertising for non-establishment political figures (this is veering into tinfoil hat conspiracy territory, so I’m going to steer clear of it, but the sentiment is the same - we are at the mercy of the big tech companies and the people that run them, instead of the other way around).

The core of the matter is that in order to remove power from the tech giants, we need to be more aware of what we use the internet for, and take the control for ourselves. While companies like Gab and 4chan offer a true free speech platform, they tend to be populated by trolls, so your mileage may vary.

# Education

In an ideal world, that little piece of the internet would mean hosting your own DNS server and hosting your own website and projects. Unfortunately, that is not at all feasible for everyone. Not everyone has the knowledge or has the capacity for that kind of knowledge. However, something as simple as a Squarespace or WordPress website (or even a Medium blog) offers a starting point to disconnecting from the juggernaut of Facebook and the other big tech companies. Naturally, this does move the problem, because you are at the mercy of the Squarespace, WordPress, or Medium terms of service, but it gives you a sense of making your own thing first. Baby steps are still steps.

# Conclusion

The internet was constructed as a place to share information. Even the beginning, with ARPANET, the connections between computers served only as a means of transferring information from one base to another. So why should we lose sight of that dream of a free transfer of information when we're dealing with companies that actively work to silence what they consider to be dissenting opinions?
