# Introduction

I want to start tracking my expenditures on a more consistent basis, as knowing when money goes is a key component of a sound financial mind.

# Method

I use a simple Google Sheets template where I write down each expenditure. It also tracks my cashback based on which card I use, since different cards offer different cashback rewards.

# March 2020

Started to go by category instead of by vendor. I feel that makes things easier on the eyes in terms of the table. Still getting used to what will work and what won't.

| Item      | Amount | Notes                                                                                       |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rent      | 832.50 |                                                                                             |
| Hobbies   | 117.48 | Includes $50 in Paperback Swap fees, as well as buying two domain names, and some VPS space |
| Charity   | 40.00  | Charitable contributions to my church                                                       |
| Groceries | 39.27  | Includes fancy $5 yogurt                                                                    |
| Utilities | 17.53  |                                                                                             |

Total: **$1,106.78** (-$74.31 from last month)
Total cashback earned: **$3.88**

Interestingly enough, I feel like I spent a lot more this month, especially on hobbies. But it really comes down actually tallying things up to see how they really are. This is why I encourage everyone to do this exercise. You never know what you end up with.
