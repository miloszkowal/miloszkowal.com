I'm leaving macOS. This post is the first post published from an Ubuntu installation on my late 2013 MacBook Pro. After reading about the morally (but not legally) reprehensible actions from Apple against Prepear, I decided that it is high time to leave the world of Apple software and embrace the Linux community in earnest. There are still some prioprietary things that I will need to wean myself off of (looking at you, VSCode), but this is the first step in what I believe is a wonderful journey of software.

There is a financial component to this as well. Linux (and even Ubuntu), with its small overhead, will hopefully prolong the life of this aging MacBook, giving me at least an extra several years. That way, I don't have to buy any new hardware until significantly later.
