# Introduction

I want to start tracking my expenditures on a more consistent basis, as knowing when money goes is a key component of a sound financial mind.

# Method

I use a simple Google Sheets template where I write down each expenditure. It also tracks my cashback based on which card I use, since different cards offer different cashback rewards. 

# January 2020

The biggest expenditure this month was PaperBackSwap, a service that my fianc√©e and I use to swap books with other members around the country. We use them to buy our shipping, so we have to load up our "PBS Money." Some of that was reimbursed with cash from my mother-in-law, but any reimbursements will not be kept track of.
