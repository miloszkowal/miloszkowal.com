# Introduction, or The Absolute State of Modern Society

Today, silence is not really appreciated, especially in the big cities. So many are almost constantly glued to their phones, and I have no idea why. There is absolutely nothing on phones that warants constant attachment to it. People will argue that it "helps them stay connected," but to what? What in the vast external world is worth being plugged into *all the time*? The problem is that modern technology has been designed to subjugate the human mind and drain it of any capacity for independent thought (cable "news" has the same problem). 

# Greed, and how it Drives Everything

The explicit goal of all the major corporations (Facebook, Google, Fox News, etc.) is to make money for shareholders. And the only way that that money is made is if it comes from somebody else (unless the government starts aribitrarily printing money, which it has with the COVID-19 pandemic). While success itself might not be zero-sum, as each person's definition of "success" varies, monetary wealth certainly is. So because these corporations that many in the modern day are enslaved to (figuratively in the West, literally in developing countries) are at the behest of the shareholders, they will only exist as long as the general populace keeps consuming their products. That means a new iPhone every year or two, that means checking social media feeds every few minutes, that means storing as much of your data as possible in remote and proprietary data centers. Since this constant consumption is the only way to generate ever-increasing profits, we get phenomena like planned obsolescence and full-time psychologists working at Facebook and Bungie. When it comes to social media specifically, they exist to sell your eyeballs and attention to advertisers. Since the service to the consumers is free, the consumers *becomes* the product, bought by the advertisers. Cable is even more nefarious, since the consumer actually pays to have advertisements served to them.

# Social Engineering and the Modern-Day Soma

These services have trained us to effectively be addicted to them, in a perverse version of the *soma* from Huxley's *Brave New World*. Constantly checking Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, RSS feeds, etc is a small microdose of this dopamine, and it is this hit that keeps us coming back for more. The engineers and higher-ups at these companies know this, and they engineer their platforms in order to "maximize engagement," which is really newspeak for "show as many ads as possible." And if a person says that they are "immune to ads," then that person is really the most susceptible. 

With the addictive nature of modern technology, the companies behind all these platforms have effectively eliminated boredom and silence. Whether that was done deliberately we will never know. This elimination of boredom and independent thought, of course, works in the best interest of the shareholders, and those that stand to gain from the general populace's continual consumption. Because without boredom, the human mind is not free to wander. And if a mind is not left out to wander, then it will not forge the connections necessary to actually better itself, and the person. The Tibetan monks knew this when they would go for hours, or days meditating, staring at a wall. That practice is what allowed them to clear their heads and allow them to experience life directly, instead of through the interface of a phone, or through any other medium. Of course, meditation has also been co-opted by "late stage capitalism" too, with apps like *Calm* constantly peddling their meditation-as-a-service that you can subscribe to. Generations of monks meditated for thousands of years without the need for a phone.

# A Potential Solution?

It is this meditative silence that is missing from modernity, especially in urban areas. Silence allows for the brain to filter out the noise, and hone in on what is actually important. And this goes for all kinds of silence: auditory and visual. Too much of any kind of stimulation prevents one from actually succeeding. So many folks are scared of this silence, and I want to ask "why?" What will you uncover in this silence that frightens you so much, to the point that you will tether yourself to something that only exists to make money for someone else?

The solution has to come from the individuals. It is the individuals that need to realize that what they are doing is selling themselves to others, in a grotesque prositution of their attention span, and turn their personal ships around, embracing the act of creation instead of consumption.
