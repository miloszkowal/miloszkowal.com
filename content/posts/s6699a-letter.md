Dear Senator Jackson,

I am writing to you and your colleagues on behalf of myself and other artisans, musicians, and independent laborers regarding your proposed bill S6699A. We have come to the conclusion that such a bill would greatly stifle our ability to perform our work and expand our respective businesses. Consequently, since few forces can stop an entrepreneur bent on making a living with her craft, we would be all but forced to relocate to another state where such laws do not exist, and furthermoreccease to contract and employ any individuals residing in this great state. This would lead to a very substantial loss in tax revenue for New York, and would thus require additional tax increases for the citizens in residence here, which would further perpetuate the downward spiral of capital flight, as demonstread by over one million people leaving the tristate area in the last decade. We fear that this trend is only going to get worse should this legislation come to pass.

My parents came to this wonderful country with a singular goal: provide a better life for their two sons. We took our version of the American Dream to mean starting our own businesses and scaling them to be sustainable. By lumping together small business owners, independent consultants, and other entrepreneurs, with behemoths such as Uber and Lyft, you inadvertently hand the sword over to Goliath while simultaneously castrating David.

At no point during the independent contract (IC) hiring process, is the situation one-sided. All ICs willingly enter into agreements with the entity contracting the work, bearing all the responsibility that that entails. Many independent contractors are such simply for the benefit of additional income and the freedom that being your own employer provides. It is these people that are disproportionately affected by bill S6699A.

Personally, my own livelihood as a software engineering consultant is at stake because of this bill. Many companies that have otherwise expressed interest in contracting me for my work are now backing away because of this bill, leading to a potential six-figure loss in taxable income. I know many others that will be forced to move should this bill be passed, and their livelihoods destroyed. I'm in a fortunate position to not have dependents, but some of the folks I know do.

With this in mind, we urge you to reconsider your sponsorship of this bill in its totality, and instead encourage individual responsibility in IC positions.

If I or any of my friends are misunderstanding the bill or any part thereof, we highly encourage a response with any additional clarification.

Sincerely,
Milosz Kowal
