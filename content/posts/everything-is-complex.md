I'm a creator. Even something as "simple" as making a candle is extraordinarily complex. The thing is, that's okay, and even the way things should be.

Take something like Excel, for example, which is probably one of the most used pieces of software in the world. Now, if we presume that programming is trivial (which it most certainly _isn't_), Excel itself is a rabbit hole of features, to the point that Amazon can release a repository just about computer vision in Excel with only formulae.[^1] This is an insanely complex field of AI expressed in a spreadsheet application. And we haven't even touched on VBA, macros, and plug-ins yet (but they are beyond the scope of this post).

But back to candles. At first glance, candlemaking is just wax and a wick in a jar. But then, what kind of wax? What kind of wick, waxed or unwaxed, and from what material? How are we going to adhere the wick to the jar? What if we're not making a jar candle, but a taper, what method will we use to make it. The questions go on and on, and we haven't even melted any wax yet (different waxes have different melting points, by the way, so that has to be kept in mind when melting). Oh, and adding scents increases the complexity manyfold.

Each degree of freedom adds exponentially more complexity to a problem. In terms of set theory, this is expressed as the amount of subsets of a set. If we have one object in a set, we actually have two subsets (the empty set and the set itself), two options give us four choices, and three blows it up to eight different solutions. Generalizing this, each subset of _n_ elements has 2<sup>n</sup> subsets. Going back to our candle example, three wax choices give us eight different options, from not making a candle at all, to mixing all three waxes (let's not talk about proportions, because that's whole other can of worms). Obviously, not all choices are _good_ choices, but they exist nonetheless.

Modern culture is blindly committed to removing complexity from our lives: every problem can be solved with the touch of a button and a corresponding charge on a credit card. Why bother learning about something as fundamental as cooking when "healthy" meals can be delivered to the door? And everyone who eats for every meal of every day (I know people like this) justifies this with comparative economics: "Oh, I make more than _\$COST_OF_MEAL_ per hour, so why would I want to spend an hour cooking?"

The problem with comparative economics is that it doesn't hold water unless you're working literally all the time, which is, of course, unsustainable. I highly doubt the folks making $100K+ work during regular dinner time. And yet they have maids clean their McMansions, have meals delivered, and drive inefficient vehicles. And then you get the stories of people being unhappy with their $2M bonuses[^2] and "barely getting by" on multiple six figure salaries.[^3]<sup>,</sup>[^4]<sup>,</sup>[^5]

Even more importantly, what happens during a recession, an injury, or anything else that might cause job loss? Reliance on perceived simplicity (because, really, services like Amaozn just shift the complexity from the consumer to the complicated logistics system) ties one down to systems beyond their control. If the systems fail, the person relying on them is screwed.

By embracing complexity, one becoes independent of the systems that claim to make things simple, but in reality shield the individual from the complexity of living itself. These systems are fragile and should _not_ be relied on, since their expected growth at the hands of profit-seeking shareholders is simply unsustainable.
