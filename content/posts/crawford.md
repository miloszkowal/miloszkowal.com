## Short Review:

Overall, Crawford’s work is a natural sequel to Shop Class as Soulcraft: it presents a view of learning that is inherently tied to the world itself, as opposed to the Enlightenment ideas that we can somehow be detached from the reality in which we live. It encourages the reader to step outside of the cultural bubble (at least in the West) of attempting to abstract everything we live in and connect with it instead. While dense at time, The World Beyond Your Head is a refreshing take on learning itself, and provides engaging anecdotes (who knew that organ makers can be so interesting?) in an attempt to drive home its point.

## The Shortfalls of the Enlightenment

The crux of Crawford’s book is that the hyper-individualistic nature of Enlightenment thought leaves out a sizable portion of the way that people actually interact with the world around them. Enlightenment philosophers assumed that the individual is a perfectly rational being within their own head (which may be true), but Crawford asserts that this is only the case in sterile, solitary environments, which the real world definitely is not. In fact, not only do we act on the world using our faculties, our world acts us in in more ways than one. For example, he provides the case that a pair of sticks can mean different things to different people in different contexts (he uses the example of chopsticks vs. drumsticks). This is informed through a variety of factors, most notably our previous experiences with the real world, which includes the culture in which we live, the circumstances of our present physical situation (whether we’re in front of a roll of sushi or in front of a drum set), and our cultural and personal upbringing (Crawford goes on an amazing analysis of how *Mickey Mouse Clubhouse* does not teach children to be problem solvers at all, but instead only be passive followers in a world that is constantly gunning for our attention)

## Positives

* I distinctly enjoyed the analysis of modernity and how we have become increasingly inward focused since the Enlightenment
* The final section about organ makers and their craft was a phenomenal way of bringing everything together in a very concrete, real-world example

## Negatives

* While well-written, Crawford is a bit dense in his word choice at times. Granted, there are a lot of distractions in my reading environment that are beyond my immediate control, but I still found some of his explanations unnecessarily verbose.
