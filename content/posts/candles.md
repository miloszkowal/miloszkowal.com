# Introduction

I love candles. I think that fire is one of the manliest things in the whole world, and that taming fire (or taming anything) is a manly pursuit. Candles are an intersection of that. It's a big shame that candles these days are primarily marketed to women, with smells like "Eucalyptus Mint" or "Ocean Breeze." So I thought to myself, "let's make some candles and really stick it to the man." There are numerous benefits to making your own candles.

* It's cheaper
* You control the level of scent (the Bath and Body Works candles are extraordinarly pungent)
* Saves you a trip to a store (spending less time in retail establishments saves you money)

With those three things in mind, I set out to make my first candle and do the reserach on the process. Luckily, there's a great art of manliness article that explains basically the entire process. I highly encourage you to visit it, but I will in essence recreate it here. Due to their simplicity and all-natural nature, I will be making beeswax candles.

# Sourcing the Wax

Beeswax is the most expensive was for candle-making purposes. If you notice, very few stores (if any) actually sell beeswax candles. Most of the beeswax you find is on Etsy and other artisinal stores. I have not seen major retail outlets, such as Bath and Body Works, stocking candles made of beeswax, as it is just not profitable. When making beeswax, you can assume roughly $10 per pound of the stuff, signficantly more than the same amount of soy wax or paraffin wax. But again, we're going for top-notch stuff, so let's treat ourselves to the best.

Personally, I get my beesax from Amazon, in the largest quantities I can find, which is 10 pounds at the moment. If there's a bee farm next to where you live, feel free to check there, as beeswax is a byproduct of the honey-making process.

# The melting and pouring process

As with cooking, you want to get your mise en place first. I recommend using a double boiler for melting the wax, as well as a rubber spatula for mixing the wax (especially on the double boiler front, get one that is dedicated just for candles, as you can never get all the wax out, and you don't want wax in your fondue. I personally use this one). I also cover some of my work surface with paper towels, to make cleanup in the case of spillage significantly easier. Also set out your wicks, jars, and pens during this step.

As with any double boiler melting process, place your wax into the double boiler and fill the pot with water. Once it starts, it shouldn't take long for the wax to melt. Below is a table of the different waxes and their melting points.

Using a candy thermometer is useful here, but not required.

A pro tip is to dip the end of your wick (the part you adhere to the jar) in the wax as you place it into the jar. This gives it a little extra adhesion to the jar as you pour. Then stiffen the wick using the pen like so, so that it is held taut as the wax cools and sets.

# Scents

Once the wax is melted, you want to take a few moments for the temperature to drop a bit before adding any scents in, and make sure to use oven mitts when lifting the double boiler, as it has heated up substantially!

Scents come in two different forms: essential oils and fragrance oils. Essentials oils tend to be cheaper, but they also have less potent of a smell. Frangrance oils are pricier, but they are thicker in their scent, so you need less of them per pound of wax. Major candle retailers use essential oils to save on price, but I find their scent to be too cloying. With beeswax, you don't have to worry about any scents, as beeswax in and of itself gives off a rich natural scent.

If you do choose to add a scent, make sure to use your spatula to mix it throughout the melted wax.

Once you do that, you can slowly pour the wax into your jar that you've set out in the above step.

# Conclusion

Once the wax sets, you're done! Congratulations, you've just learned a new skill, and saved yourself a crapton of money buying candles. From here on, you can extend this knowledge into making different types of candles, such as tapers, which are great to have candlelit dinner to.
