I love to cook. But I don't love bloat on the internet. This is why I decided to make [opensourcerecipes.net](https://opensourcerecipes.net/), a community-driven website that allows anyone to contribute their favorite recipes, modify existing ones, and engage in meaningful discussion about recipes and other projects. My goal is to make this website a safe space from JS, ads, trackers, and other garbage that plagues the internet today. I hope that you all enjoy and contribute in any way possible. Ways to contribute are in the README file on the project's [GitHub](https://github.com/miloszkowal/opensourcerecipes.net).
