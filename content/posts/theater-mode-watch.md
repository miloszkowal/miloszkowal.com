With the release of watchOS 3.2, Apple introduce a feature called "Theater Mode," which keeps the display dark when moving. The official line from Apple is that it "stays dark in movie theaters, concerts, or other public events." This is obviously helpful, but it can be taken to the next level, as a digital minimalist practice.

Inspired by Cal Newport's latest book, the goal of digital minimalism is to make one re-evaulate their relationship with their electronics, and only use what is the most meaningful.

I've had an Apple Watch since it originally came out in 2015. Since then, I've upgraded to the Series 2, and then to the Series 3 (which I'm wearing now as I type this). While good features like an independent App Store have been introduced since (I never used it), I was most taken aback by the Theater Mode feature, as it presented a new way of interfacing with my watch.

Previously, any slight movement of my wrist would set off the watch, causing it to spring to life in all of its glory. However, this was often not what I wanted, and even though the accelerometer got better as time went on (and as versions of both the hardware and software increased), I still found it not-so-great in terms of not being distracting. Theater Mode provided an end to all of this.

I keep Theater Mode on all the time now. Its purpose is two-fold: 1) it prevents it from going off when I don't want it, so I don't have a glare in the corner of my eye, and 2) because of the above, it saves battery, which now makes my two-year-old watch last a few days. Overall, it has proven quite useful in terms of redefining my relationship with the Apple Watch, to the point where I am no longer certain I want to keep it. After all, it looks like a house arrest anklet, but on your wrist.
