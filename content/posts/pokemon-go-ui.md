I was recently hired for a rather peculiar Photoshop job: place the elements of the Pokémon Go interface on an image of a girl dressed in a Pikachu outfit. One of these kinds of outfits:

It was actually a pretty fun project, and it only took about an hour. I'll probably do a tutorial on how to recreate the Pokémon Go UI and post it online for those interested. However, the project got me thinking about the importance of good interface aesthetics when it comes to photography, design, and media creation. This relates largely to photographic composition, as the path the eye travels across the image has to be efficient. The same is true for any interface, particularly those of mobile apps: elements of the UI have to be easily accessible, correctly and visibly labeled, and responsive immediately. If the interface fails in any of the these three aspects, then the app is ruined. So let's go look at some key interactions in Pokémon Go, and dissect them.

### Screen 1: The Main Screen

The main screen is surprisingly simple and focuses on the main point of the game: finding Pokémon to capture (of course, if you're lucky enough to even encounter them after the latest series of updates). The game places your avatar in the center of the screen, with a radiating circle of 70m (down from 100m in previous updates). This immediately focuses your attention on your avatar and his or her location in the world. Good and simple design decision. The avatar is also heavily contrasted from the light green of the grassy areas or the slightly darker green of the roads. It is also the only three-dimensional elements of the environment apart from interactable elements (more on that later). The contrast should be immediately familiar to photographers, as we place the subject on a variety of backgrounds to evoke any particular feeling. However, there's almost always some element of contrast, whether it's exposure, color, or composition. 

From the main screen, one can access the infamous "Nearby" panel. Placing current its usefulness aside, we as the players immediately know that that panel is supposed to be on the screen only for a brief period of time. The only location where that panel touches the edge of the screen is on the bottom, making it reminiscent of a card. It can also be quickly dismissed with a swipe down, a deliberate decision on the part of the developers, since the player is not meant to spend a lot of time looking at what Pokémon are nearby, but rather focused on picking one to track and then capture.

### Screen 2: The Encounter Screen

The encounter screen is where the bulk of the actual action of the game takes place. In that screen, the player can use items, throw Pokéballs in an attempt to capture the encountered Pokemon, as well as run away from the encounter. This is where the actual gameplay of the game takes place. While it is meant to be fast-paced interactions, the game also allows children and people with slower motor skills to play successfully by implementing a crude turn-based system, likely modeled after the fighting mechanics in the handheld Pokémon games. After an action is performed, the user gets the chance to prep for and then execute another action. However, after a Pokéball is thrown, the encounter has a chance to terminate by the Pokémon running away, depending on the level of the player. They key takeaway from this is that the interface elements in this screen are easily accessible and actually encourage the player to capture the Pokémon, as the option to run from the encounter is rather inconveniently placed at the top left of the screen. The option to turn off the augmented reality feature is in the top-right, in order to discourage players from disabling it (it's on by default as a mode of "immersion"). 

### Screen(s) 3: Pokéstops and Gyms

Pokéstops are the game's equivalent of checkpoints. At those locations, the player can restock on key items like pokéballs and potions, and gain a small amount of experience towards leveling up their character. However, those items are not given freely: the user has to interact with the Pokéstop by spinning the picture of the real-world location. Much like photographers don't give out some things freely and hide certain details in images. The Pokéstop design also reminds the player that he or she is meant to quickly interact with the Pokéstop and then move on. This is accomplished by the screen turning violet after interaction, as well as bits of the overworld being visible behind the disc that is to be spun in order to retrieve the items. 

Gyms, however, are a totally different story. They completely take you out of the overworld, and place you into a series of encounters with others' Pokémon for control of that gym. The player also has to stay in the area of the gym in order to attempt to challenge it (I won't get into the nuances of the different teams, training Pokémon at gyms, or any of that, since the mechanics are largely the same). This is meant to be a more "permanent" interaction, since the player loses vision of the map that the avatar is standing on.

Of note is also the fact that gyms and Pokéstops are the only 3D elements in the world. They immediately stand out, since they're on the same plane as our avatar. That was likely done purposely, as interactive environments need to be obvious to the average player. If interactions and progression are buried under menus, interface items, or don't stand out, then the player quickly gets lost and closes the app.

### Conclusion

The interface of Pokémon Go provides an interesting look at the ways simple design decisions can greatly influence player interaction. This is something to keep in mind when designing your own experiences or composing your own photographs.
