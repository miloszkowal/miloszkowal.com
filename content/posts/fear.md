The COVID-19 Pandemic has instilled a fear in me, and it's not a fear of the disease itself (I'm pretty young myself, and very low risk). But it's a fear of the change of the status quo. With the recent wave of layoffs and other economic catastrophes, makes me realize that nothing should be taken for granted (as an aside, I should've internalized this already as a Mr. Money Mustache reader, thanks to [this article](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2017/04/25/there-are-no-guarantees/)).

I'm grateful that I haven't been laid off from my job. This allows me to keep the lights on and feed myself while I keep working and live in this quarantine.
