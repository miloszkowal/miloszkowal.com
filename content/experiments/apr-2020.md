## Objective

Cold showers are shown to be quite good for you, helping you sleep, improving circulation, and so on. I want to spend every day this month taking a cold shower. Now, I don't have a thermometer to measure the water, but not using the warm setting on the shower 
seems to be a safe bet when dealing with this.

### Day 7: 2020-04-07

I still haven't gotten used to it, but I found that a lot of it is simply mind over matter. During last night's shower, I realized that my primitive ancestors have taken their baths in cold streams and that heat was a luxury for them. Taking heat for granted is a 
folly of modern man, so it would be best for us to forgo that every once in a while.

I also realized that part of the motivation behind this experiment is monetary: a cold shower is signficantly cheaper than a warm one.
