## About the Monthly Experiment Project

I enjoy doing monthly experiments on myself, just to see if I can do it. Most of these experiments will involve depriving myself of something that I previously enjoy, but I know doesn't serve me in the long-term. Sometimes, the experiment will be scurrying to create something in a month. Either way, the experiments page will serve as a log of my findings and some other observations.

## Objective

Abstain from watching YouTube videos of any kind, on any platform.

## Method

Leverage Pihole to block YouTube on my devices, and use blocking in the hosts file to block it as well.

## Observations

### Day 1: 2020-02-01
