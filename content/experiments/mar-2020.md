## Objective

Lent is usually a time when people give up certain foods. My father-in-law always gives up ice cream. So I thought to myself to take this one step further and follow Michael Pollan's Food Rules. For a quick and dirty summary of the rules, see [here](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/05/11/food-rules-a-shortcut-to-better-health/) and [here](https://liveyourlegend.net/michael-pollans-top-14-food-rules-to-healthy-eating/).

## Method

Read labels on foods, and internalize the rules. If necessary, refer to them in cases of doubt and before some meals.

## Observations

### Day 8: 2020-03-08

This is *hard*. So many foods have a sweetener in the top three ingredients. This is by far the hardest rule to follow. Rules like shopping the outside of the supermarket, saving meat for a treat, and eating my colors come easy by comparison. So many of my foods, though, have some kind of sweetener in the top three ingredients, and it's hard to abstain from them, as they make regular food boring (hot sauces are notorious for this). I'm tempted to relax the rules to allow for sauces, but that would defeat the purpose of the experiment. So I'm going to stick to not doing that.
