# About

I love making things. This holds true in software (where I love creating cool tools for people to use), and in the real world (where I create candles to make peoples' rooms nicer). At the end of the day, I sleep at night knowing that I've contributed more than I have used in the world. 

I graduated *cum laude* from Trinity College in Hartford, CT with a degree in math and theater (nice combination, I know). I worked at Moody's Corporation as a software engineer on their NLP platforms, at HSBC as a business analyst, and at Metacore Technologies as a DevOps engineer, where I discovered the absolute joy that is cloud computing. If any employers are looking for a DevOps guy, hit me up at me@miloszkowal.com

I also make candles and other nice-smelling goods as the proprietor of Forest Hills Fragrance Company. I strongly believe in the cottage industry as a model for community-building, and making my own candles instead of sourcing them from "Big Candle" (Bath and Body Works, Yankee Candle, etc.) is a way to accomplish that.
